During my internship, I designed and implemented a metalearning module within the pipegenie genetic programming framework. Inspired by the architecture of Auto-sklearn, I developed a new metalearning component (located in the pipegenie/metalearning directory) to intelligently warm-start the evolutionary search process. This module analyzes dataset meta-features to select a promising set of initial pipelines, significantly accelerating the optimization process.
