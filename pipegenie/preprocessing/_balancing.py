    A marker component for balancing imbalanced class distributions.

    This component does not transform the data itself. Instead, it serves as a
    marker for the evolutionary engine to apply a weighting strategy during
    the evaluation of the pipeline.

    Parameters
    ----------
    strategy : str, {'none', 'weighting'}, default='none'
        The balancing strategy. If 'weighting', sample weights will be
        calculated and passed to the final estimator's `fit` method.
